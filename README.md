# Vehicle Usage Data Analysis and Carbon Footprint Estimation

## Overview
This project provides a system for analyzing vehicle usage data and estimating the associated carbon footprint for vehicles across different companies and time slots. The data is retrieved from a MySQL database and presented in multiple formats, with the option to break down the data by company type, vehicle type, and different times of the day (morning, afternoon, evening, night). The system also estimates the carbon footprint based on the distance traveled by vehicles, which helps in understanding their environmental impact.

## What I Learned

### MySQL and Python Integration
- I learned how to integrate Python with MySQL using the `mysql.connector` package.
- The importance of writing efficient SQL queries to retrieve and process data from multiple related tables.

### Data Aggregation
- I gained experience in grouping and aggregating data using SQL's `SUM()` and `GROUP BY` functions to calculate total distances traveled by vehicles.

### Carbon Footprint Estimation
- I implemented the logic for calculating the carbon footprint of each vehicleâ€™s usage based on distance and emission factors, which can help in understanding the environmental impact of transportation.

### Dynamic Reporting
- I implemented a dynamic reporting system that allows users to interact with the data in different formats and segments. This can be useful for fleet management, sustainability reports, and research purposes.

### Time-Based Data Analysis
- I learned how to segment and filter data based on time ranges (morning, afternoon, evening, night), which allows for more granular insights into vehicle usage patterns during different parts of the day.

## Future Enhancements

### Real-Time Data Integration
- The system could be expanded to handle real-time vehicle usage data from telematics systems or GPS devices to improve reporting accuracy.

### Data Visualization
- Adding charts, graphs, and other data visualizations to represent the total distance, carbon footprint, and usage patterns across different vehicle types and times of day.

### Automated Reporting
- Introduce automated report generation and email notifications to send periodic updates on vehicle usage and carbon footprint calculations to stakeholders.

### Optimization
- Optimize the SQL queries and the Python code for performance, especially for large datasets.
